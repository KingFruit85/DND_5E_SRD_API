# Dungeons & Dragons 5E SRD Random Character API
The bulk of the code was done whilst I was first learning c# so sorry if i've commited any code wa- crimes.

The end goal is for it to generate a validrandomised character, with potentiall other endpoints that serve up other random content like ability scores and backstories etc.

All content found within the application should only be sourced from the Open game licence SRD found here : https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd

Or here in website form: https://www.d20srd.org/index.htm

Please feel free to contribute, itâ€™s primarily here as a learning experience.
